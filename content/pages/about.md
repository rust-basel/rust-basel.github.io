We are Roland, Silen and Yasin and we are Rust enthusiasts.  
Dragged by our enthusiasm for the language, we try to connect all other rust enthusiasts in and around the Basel(CH) area.

We both work as Software Engineers and use Rust in our private projects as well as in our day to day jobs.

## What's the topic?
Rust - of course.

You will find all resources from our [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/rust-basel/) and workshops here. Each post resembles either a meetup or a workshop about a specific rust topic.

## What to expect
Links, resources, slides and/or videos from our meetups and workshops we did.

## Learning by doing
Jokes aside. Most of our workshops or meetups are topics we find interesting and worth sharing. 
From time to time we also organize workshops for people that are interested in learning rust, or rust specific topics. Stay tuned!

If you also want to share a rust specific topic - contact us and we will find a way to share your topic with other fellow Rustaceans. 

Until then, have a great time!
