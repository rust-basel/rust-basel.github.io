## About Us

We are the Rust-Basel, a Swiss non-profit organization dedicated to bringing together Rust enthusiasts in and around the Basel area. Our community has evolved over time, and we're proud to have grown from a group of passionate individuals to a small organization.

## Our Journey

Initially, the meetup was founded by Roland 2019. Then in 2022 Yasin and afterwards 2024 Silen joined to organize the meetups. As the community grew, we transitioned into a Swiss non-profit organization in 2025, where Jan and JÃ´natas joined. You can join as well!

## Our Mission

We continue to nurture a community that shares knowledge, experiences, and ideas related to Rust. Our [GitHub group](https://github.com/rust-basel) lists our members, and we invite you to join us. Whether you're a seasoned Rust developer or just starting to explore the language, we welcome you in Basel's Rust community.

## What's the topic?
Rust - of course.

You will find all resources from our [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/rust-basel/) and workshops here. Each post resembles either a meetup or a workshop about a specific rust topic.

## Learning by doing
Jokes aside. Most of our workshops or meetups are topics we find interesting and worth sharing.
From time to time we also organize workshops for people that are interested in learning rust, or rust specific topics. Stay tuned!

If you also want to share a rust specific topic - contact us and we will find a way to share your topic with other fellow Rustaceans.

Until then, have a great time!
