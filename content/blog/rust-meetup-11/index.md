# Rust Basel Meetup #11 –

Our 11th on-site meetup, generously sponsored by [letsboot.ch] and by [E+H Digital Solutions](https://www.endress.com/de/endress-hauser-gruppe/kompetenzen-der-product-centers/endress-hauser-digital-solutions).
was held at the Letsboot offices

### 🎤 The Talk

- **Jan Cristina** Diplomat: a tool for generating polyglot bindings to Rust code:[slides](https://github.com/jcrist1/diplomat-talk/blob/main/main.pdf)

### 🧃 Community + Snacks

There was a lot of discussion about different ways of getting rust code into non-rust code-bases. Definitely a more advanced topic, but there was a lot of interest as rust makes it easier to connect to other language ecosystems.

### 🗺️ Logistics Recap

The meetup was hosted at Letsboot, in Aeschenplatz
