# Rust Basel Meetup #11 –

Our 4th in-person workshop sponsored by [letsboot](letsboot.ch) and [E+H Digital Solutions](https://www.endress.com/de/endress-hauser-gruppe/kompetenzen-der-product-centers/endress-hauser-digital-solutions).

### 🎤 Topic

Rust is known for being applicable to a many different levels of programming, but one exciting area that Rust opens up is embedded computing. In this fun workshop we got a
taste of working with microcontrollers using Rust. We were generously sponsored so we could provide [ESP32 microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) to participants.
Participants learned how to

- connect to the microcontroller and flash it over USB
- connect the microcontroller to simple electronics
- interface with sensors
- buddy a microcontroller with a lightweight SoC

The full documentation for the workshop is available here

We even got lunch at Vito Aeschenplatz!
