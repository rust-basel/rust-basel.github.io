# Rust Basel Meetup #11 –

Our 12th on-site meetup, generously sponsored by [E+H Digital Solutions](https://www.endress.com/de/endress-hauser-gruppe/kompetenzen-der-product-centers/endress-hauser-digital-solutions).

### 🎤 The Talk

- **Silen Locatelli** Your first Rust CLI project

### 🧃 Community + Snacks

We had a diverse group of attendants on a very hot day. Discussions included project architecture, dependency bloat, and even a bit about the Zig programming language and Tigerbeetle,
a double entry financial transaction database. After the talk we enjoyed Pizza from [Vito](https://www.vito.ch/), and the beautiful weather by the Rhein

### 🗺️ Logistics Recap

We were at a new venue this time in [khaus](https://www.khaus.ch/) on a very warm day
