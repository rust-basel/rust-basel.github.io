# Rust Basel Association Annual Meeting

On April 8th 2025 the Rust Basel Association had its founding meeting as a formal association.
This was done to enable the association to open a bank account, collect sponsorship and use those
funds to organise talks, workshops and events.

As a formal association we are required to hold annual meetings to handle certain administrative
responsibilities. This meeting is open for all to attend, but only registered members will be able
to vote. We are not accepting membership applications prior to the meeting (as members need to be
notified 30 days before the meeting) but are happy to accept applications afterwards.

- **Location:** Markthalle Basel
- **Agenda:**
  - Approval of minutes of last general meeting (founding meeting)
  - Review previous year's report and budget
  - Approve next years budget
  - Appoint new board of the association
  - Approve changes to the statutes

More details will appear on our discord
