# Rust Basel Meetup #11 –

Our 13th on-site meetup, generously sponsored and hosted by [letsboot](letsboot.ch)

### 🎤 The Talks

- **Jusong Yu** How Rust enables you to create a domain specific language
- **Jônatas Oliveira** One login to rule them all

With the fall air getting cooler and the nights getting longer we had another couple of interesting talks. First Jusong Yu discussed how Rust enabled his team to build
a domain specific language for workflow orchestration: [slides](https://github.com/unkcpz/slides-basel-rust-meetup-2025)

Then Jônatas Oliveira presented [keyrunes](https://github.com/jonatasoli/keyrunes) a modern, attribute-aware access control engine written in Rust, offering a lightweight
alternative to keycloak.

### 🧃 Community + Snacks

We had some new joiners again, and lots of discussion, with some snacks as well
