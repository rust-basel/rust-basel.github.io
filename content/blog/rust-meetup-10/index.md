# Rust Basel Meetup #10 – Talks, Snacks, and Community Vibes

On March 18th, we hit a nice round number: **Rust Basel Meetup #10** 🎉
Thanks to our generous hosts at **MDPI**, we gathered once again at Grosspeteranlage 5 to share knowledge, laughter, and stories from the Rust trenches.

This time, we were treated to **two insightful talks** from community members—and the promise of a third, TBD-style!

### 🎤 The Talks

- **Yasin Gündüz** opened the evening with a philosophical yet practical dive into *"How to inject Rust into people's hearts, minds, and production code."* His journey touched on more than just syntax—it was about winning hearts (and org charts) with Rust's strengths.

- **Michael Kefeder** followed with *"Anecdotal evidence that Rust is not hard to learn or slowing down development."* What started as a personal take on learning Rust quickly turned into a broader discussion about the language’s ecosystem. From package management to dev tooling to onboarding juniors, this talk lit a spark that carried into many conversations throughout the evening.

- **The open slot** remained just that—open. If you’ve got a Rust story, experiment, or lesson learned, we’d love to hear it at a future meetup. Ping us on Discord!

### 🧃 Community + Snacks

As always, the conversations flowed long after the talks ended. With drinks in hand and pizza on plates (thanks again to **E+H Digital Solutions** for sponsoring the food 🙌), we huddled around laptops, shared projects, debated error handling strategies, and dove into Rust's evolving ecosystem.

We also welcomed a few new faces—some folks brand-new to Rust, and others already deep into it. Whether you're writing your first `main()` or refactoring a codebase in safe concurrency, **Rust Basel is for everyone.**

### 🗺️ Logistics Recap

The meetup was hosted at MDPI, just a 10-minute walk from Basel SBB. Pro tip for next time: the elevator is small but mighty. And don't forget to ring at **MDPI** on the doorbell screen.
